<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lab Heating and Drying Ovens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forced Air Circulation Ovens</li><li>Gravity Convection Ovens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lab heating and drying ovens are essential in various scientific and industrial applications. There are two primary types: forced air circulation ovens and gravity convection ovens. Forced air circulation ovens utilize fans to distribute heated air uniformly, ensuring consistent temperature and faster drying times. In contrast, gravity convection ovens rely on natural air movement, where warmer air rises and cooler air descends, leading to less uniform heating. Each type serves different requirements depending on the sensitivity of the materials being processed.</p></p>
