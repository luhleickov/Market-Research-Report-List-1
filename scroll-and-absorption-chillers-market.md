<p><h1>Scroll and Absorption Chillers Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Material, By Type, By End-user, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2025 - 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Scroll and Absorption Chillers Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Scroll and absorption chillers are two distinct technologies used for cooling applications in commercial, industrial, and residential settings. Scroll chillers utilize a pair of interleaved spiral elements to compress refrigerant, offering high efficiency and a compact design. They are favored for their reliability and lower maintenance requirements. Absorption chillers, on the other hand, use heat sources like natural gas or waste heat instead of mechanical energy to drive the cooling process. These chillers are particularly relevant in markets focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy usage.</p><p>The Scroll and Absorption Chillers Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period. Key drivers for this growth include the increasing demand for energy-efficient cooling systems amid rising temperatures and stringent environmental regulations. The trend toward sustainable and eco-friendly technologies is propelling the adoption of absorption chillers, particularly in industrial applications. Additionally, advancements in scroll compressor technology are enhancing the performance and efficiency of scroll chillers, making them increasingly popular in various sectors. Overall, the market is characterized by innovation and the integration of smart technologies aimed at optimizing energy consumption and operational efficiency.</p></p>
