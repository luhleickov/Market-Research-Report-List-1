<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Pressure Reducing Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting Type</li><li>Pilot Operated Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water pressure reducing valves (PRVs) market comprises two primary types: direct acting and pilot operated. Direct acting PRVs use a diaphragm and spring mechanism to regulate pressure directly from the inlet to the outlet, making them simple and efficient for residential and low-flow applications. In contrast, pilot operated PRVs utilize a secondary pilot valve to control the main valve, offering enhanced pressure regulation for larger systems or high-demand applications. Each type serves specific needs in managing water pressure effectively.</p></p>
